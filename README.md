I removed all sensitive information, you'll find a lot of "x" instead of them.

# Removed Projects
i removed some of the projects I've worked because they're internal management systems and are highly confidentials, most of them are .net projects so i'll upload some project examples I have. they are in the .net folder.


# Stij
I developed a page to show a lot of statistics that are taken from a database, I used Google charts to do that. Furthermore, I also was developing a module, so it can show you a heatmap of locations, it was cancelled, though.


# EZ
It is, as its name says, a system to ease programming data to show it in clients screens.
You can upload images, text, videos or change the music your screen is displaying through xibo player.


# Villas del fresno
That is a system to upload, download and mange various kind of documents and data of clients. It gives you the chance to modify all data whenever you want if you have the authorization.


# Screenshots
In the screenshot folder, you can find some other pages I've worked on or that I've managed.
